HYDRA-130 TT-A - cocotb test for the Mathematical Operation MUX tile
Copyright (c) 2026 Aleksander J. Norman
SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

Runs against RTL by default and against the gate-level netlist with GATES=yes,
which is what TinyTapeout's CI does. The same test must pass both.

The descriptor is 128 bits and the tile has 8 input pins, so it is shifted in
serially, MSB first, then a `go` pulse presents it.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING CHECKED
------------------------------
Not "did a dispatch happen". The tile is asked for TWO tile sizes on either
side of the roofline crossover the whole cost model turns on, and the answers
must DIFFER:

    GEMM INT8 4x4x4  ->  SIMD, because the array's 64-cycle setup dominates
    GEMM INT8 8x8x8  ->  TPU,  because compute overtakes setup

A test confirming only that some engine was chosen would pass against a
dispatch unit hardwired to a constant.
